# AI Study Buddy

AI Study Buddy is a simple app to help students study better. It combines tools like uploading notes (text, PDFs, images, audio, videos), making quizzes, using a Pomodoro timer, earning rewards, finding weak spots, chatting with an AI tutor, connecting with study partners, and discussing topics in a community forum (like StackOverflow). The app is built to be fast, grow with more users, and easy to update.

## What It Does

- **Upload Notes**: Add text, PDFs or images(like lecture slides or handwritten notes). The app reads them with AI.
- **Audio/Video Support**: Upload lecture audio or videos to get transcripts, summaries, or quizzes.
- **Quizzes**: Creates practice quizzes from your notes to help you learn.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Helps you focus with timed study and break sessions.
- **Rewards**: Earn points, badges, and climb the leaderboard for studying.
- **Find Weak Spots**: Shows what you need to study more based on your notes.
- **AI Tutor**: Ask questions and get clear answers, like a personal tutor.
- **Study Partners**: Connects you with students studying similar topics.
- **Community Forum**: Discuss topics, ask questions, and share tips.
